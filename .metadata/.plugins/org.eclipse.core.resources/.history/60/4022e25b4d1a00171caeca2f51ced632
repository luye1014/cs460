 * This is a helper for understanding get into oracle created by dr. Mccann
 * At the time of this writing, the version of Oracle is 11.2g, and
 * the Oracle JDBC driver can be found at
 *   /opt/oracle/product/10.2.0/client/jdbc/lib/ojdbc14.jar
 * on the lectura system in the UofA CS dept.
 * (Yes, 10.2, not 11.2.  It's the correct jar file but in a strange location.)
 *
 * To compile and execute this program on lectura:
 *
 *   Add the Oracle JDBC driver to your CLASSPATH environment variable:
 *
 *         export CLASSPATH=/opt/oracle/product/10.2.0/client/jdbc/lib/ojdbc14.jar:${CLASSPATH}
 *
 *     (or whatever shell variable set-up you need to perform to add the
 *     JAR file to your Java CLASSPATH)
 *
 *   Compile this file:
 *
 *         javac JDBC.java
 *
 *   Finally, run the program:
 *
 *         java JDBC <oracle username> <oracle password>

 |	Description:  
 |		Embedding SQL within another programming language is nice for applications that require more
 |		complex calculations or manipulations than plain SQL can handle. Many DBMSes have add-ons that can be
 | 		used for developing nice applications, but even they may not be flexible enough to create the application you
 |		have in mind.
 |		As many of you know from being educated in Arizona. the state has used the Arizona Instrument to Measure
 |		Standards (AIMS) test to assess educational progress of grade-school students in recent years. Starting with
 |		the 2010 year and continuing through 2014, the Arizona Department of Education posted school-by-school
 |      results on its web site as Microsoft Excel (.xls) files. Its easy to use a spreadsheet program to save those files
 |      to CSV (comma-separated value) text format, which is a good format for reading into a program, and from
 |      there inserting into a database.
 |
 |	Techniques:  The program have steps are as follows:
 |   	1. using Libra office to change xls to csv file
 |	   	2. Using srubData I created to clean up data and use load.clt to import dataRead
 |     	3. Prog3 is a JDBC based program to connect to oracle 
 |	    4. run program to query the queries in database (including five tables I created)
 |
 |   Known Bugs:  None
